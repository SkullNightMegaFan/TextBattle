If you attack all the way through(by pressing 1) you will win the battle. 

The hippie will heal when it's hp falls below 15. 

You can also choose to heal using the heal spell(pressing 2 on a keyboard). It no longer works if your psi runs out.

If you want to fast forward the battle you can use PkStarstorm and screenwipe the enemies. It does use all your PSI not that it matters.
You can in fact lose by pressing other commands such as 3 or 4. You will do nothing, and the enemy hippie will still attack.

If you press try 69 as a command you will instantly die and be made fun of, by the narrator AKA me.
